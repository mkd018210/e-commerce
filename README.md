# e-commerce
About:
This application allows an employer to keep track of all their employees, their department, managers, and salary.

Description:
The application allows the user pull up employees by their name, department, or manager depending on what information they need.

Challenges:
The challenges I had were getting the API to work the right way and getting it to run in Insomnia correctly.

Future Development:
For future development I would like to add on front end code.

Motivation:
My motivation was to make an application that helps internet companies use the lastest technologies to be more competative.

Success:
I was able to put in code but not sure I had much success with this project.

Contributors:
I used the starter code from our class activities and changed the information to go with my application.

User Story:

I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
